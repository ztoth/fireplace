## Fireplace emulator

This project uses 2 NeoPixel LED strips from Adafruit to create the visual effects of a
fireplace. The LED strips are driven by an Arduino Pro Mini (5V). I have attached it to the
back of the TV stand at the base, and it looks pretty cool. Add an MP3 Shield with pre-recorded
fireplace sounds to make it even more realistic.
